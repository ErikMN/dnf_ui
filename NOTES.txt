// About:
The purpose of this project is to create a functional and reliable UI for DNF
on Fedora. Debian/Ubuntus "Synaptic" is used as inspiration.

// Useful commands:
sudo dnf install libdnf5-devel libdnf-cli-devel
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel
sudo dnf --disablerepo='rpmfusion*' install gtk4-devel

// Useful links:

// TODO:
* Come up with a good name for the app
* Add install/uninstall options
* Faster app
* Nicer UI
